# Why Developers Are Excited About WASM (WebAssembly) Beyond the Browser

## Introduction

WebAssembly (WASM) has been making waves in the software engineering world since its debut in web browsers. Originally designed as a portable binary instruction format for safe and efficient execution on the web, WASM is now breaking out of the browser and redefining how we think about Software deployment and performance.

## What is WebAssembly (WASM)?

WASM is a low-level, assembly-like language with a compact binary format. It runs at near-native speed and is designed to be a compilation target for a variety of programming languages, including C/C++, Rust, Go, and more. Its primary mission was to enable high-performance applications in the browser (think: games, emulators, image/video editing) that were previously impractical in JavaScript alone.

## WASM Beyond the Browser: The Big Shift

While WASM revolutionized whatâ€™s possible on the front-end, the latest trend is its adoption outside the browser:

- **Serverless Computing**
- **Edge Computing**
- **Plugin Systems**
- **Cross-platform CLI tools**

### Why this shift?

1. **Portability**: WASM modules are platform-agnostic, running consistently across Windows, Linux, macOS, and even IoT devices.
2. **Security Sandbox**: WASM executes in a constrained environment, minimizing risks when running untrusted code.
3. **Performance**: With near-native execution speed, WASM blurs the line between interpreted and compiled code.
4. **Language Flexibility**: Write code in C, Rust, Go, or more, and compile to a single standard format.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Serverless Runtimes
Cloud providers like Fastly (with [Compute@Edge](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/wasm/)), Cloudflare Workers, and Fermyon are utilizing WASM for serverless functions. WASM modules start quickly, use less memory, and can be sandboxed for security.

### 2. Plugin Systems
Projects like Envoy Proxy and Figma use WASM to let users write plugins/extensions that can't break the main app, and can be authored in multiple languages.

### 3. Container Alternatives
WASM is being positioned as a lightweight alternative to Docker containers, with projects like [wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime), [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/), and [containerd-wasm](https://github.com/containerd/runwasi).

## How Developers Can Get Started with WASM Outside the Browser

### Tooling
- **wasmtime** and **wasmer**: Lightweight WASM runtimes.
- **WASI**: The "WebAssembly System Interface" standard exposes syscalls for filesystem, networking, etc., moving WASM closer to native apps.
- **Rust** and **Go**: Both have excellent WASM support; for Rust, [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) is a great starter tool.

### Example: Running a Hello World WASM Module

```rust
// hello.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from WASM!");
}
```

Compile to WASM:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi
```

Run with wasmtime:

```sh
wasmtime target/wasm32-wasi/debug/hello.wasm
```

## The Challenges Ahead

- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Debugging tools and system interfaces are still evolving.
- **Standardization**: WASI is still a work in progress and not all platforms implement it the same way.
- **Adoption Curve**: Teams need to learn new toolchains and adapt security models.

## Conclusion

WASM is not just for browsers anymore. As cloud and edge computing evolve, WebAssembly offers a compelling solution for portable, secure, and performant code in and out of the browser. Software engineers interested in the next wave of cloud and edge-native applications should keep a close eye on the WASM ecosystem.
